I\u0026rsquo;m Andy, an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia. I started playing video games when I was in early elementary school, and I have been playing games ever since. In high school I learned that these amazing games were built from lines and lines of code, thus sparking my interest in programming and computer science.\nI initially aimed to pursue a career in video game programming and development, but as I learned more about computer science in my university courses, I realized there are many other options to choose from in this industry. Now I am trying to learn about as many different areas as possible during my studies and Co-op work terms to see what other career options may be suitable for me.\nOutside of programming, I enjoy playing badminton, basketball, and going out with friends. For video games, I currently play League of Legends, Genshin Impact, Teamfight Tactics, and Overwatch 2. I also enjoy creating things, such as animation, storywriting, and designing new games. My family worships our cat named Ekko, based on the League of Legends and Arcane character.\nFeel free to also check out my resume!\n","date":"8 December 2022","permalink":"/about-me/","section":"Andy Li's Personal Website","summary":"Heya!
