**Heya!** I'm Andy, an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia. I started playing video games when I was in early elementary school, and I have been playing games ever since. In high school I learned that these amazing games were built from lines and lines of code, thus sparking my interest in programming and computer science.

**I initially** aimed to pursue a career in video game programming and development, but as I learned more about computer science in my university courses, I realized there are many other options to choose from in this industry. Now I am trying to learn about as many different areas as possible during my studies and Co-op work terms to see what other career options may be suitable for me.

**Outside of programming,** I enjoy playing badminton, basketball, and going out with friends. For video games, I currently play League of Legends, Genshin Impact, Teamfight Tactics, and Overwatch 2. I also enjoy creating things, such as animation, storywriting, and designing new games. My family worships our cat named Ekko, based on the League of Legends and _Arcane_ character.
