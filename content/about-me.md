**Hello!** I'm Andy, an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia. I started playing video games in early elementary school, and I have been playing ever since. In high school I learned that these amazing games were built from lines and lines of code, thus sparking my interest in programming and computer science.

**I initially** aimed to pursue a career in video game programming and development, but as I learned more about computer science in university, I realized there are many other options to choose from in this industry. Now I am trying to learn about as many different areas as possible during my studies and Co-op work terms to see what other career options may be suitable for me.

**Outside of programming,** I enjoy playing badminton, basketball, and going out with friends. I currently play League of Legends, Genshin Impact, and Marvel Rivals. I also enjoy creating and designing new things, such as animations and games. Oh, and we've got a cat named Ekko.
